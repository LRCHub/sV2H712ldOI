Dear God, I've come to repent my sins
Let Your blood wash me clean, for I'm -
I'm, I'm, I'm a rotten girl

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
The temptation flowing through my veins
I'm bounded by these shackles of shame
I promised I'd indulge no more
But my heart I can't ignore
In my dreams, they're turning up the heat
I'm a dirty, rotten girl

On lock, underneath the bleachers
Just watch, look beyond the smoke and mirrors
Heart-struck? Shun the non-believer
Our operation would never be complete

Red-hot, tension with each whisper
Snapshot, quiet moans and muffled whimpers
Come on, can't you feel the fever
Rising up, rising up to the sky?

As testaments echo, fear ignites beneath my skin
The Lord sayeth, "Halt, Thy child, don't give in to sin"
It's driving me crazy, the urge to forsake Thee
Yet, something shifts within this wicked bliss

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
Student council breathing down my neck
I wonder if they're hiding from me
Forbidden fruits before my eyes
And a taste that's so divine
My regrets rewriting history
I'm a sad, pathetic girl

Someone, please, tell me what to do
Because, honestly, I just can't stop!
I've been trying so hard and I can't stop!
What would God think?
And I, I know I'm supposed to be a good girl
But somehow, I just can't control myself
Every time I see them, touching skin to skin
My mind goes, my mind goes, ah!

Could Eve be our idol? Could she lead us through the light?
We'd all be disciples of her lemon-driven bite
Can somebody save me? The urge to forsake Thee
Still, something shifts within this wicked bliss

The power resting in my hands
For my God has other plans
In salvation, I can live my life
As an ordinary girl

I can't resist it anymore
'Cause I smell slow burn galore
All the trauma from a cobblestone
Could never beat the devil in me
An honest sinner 'til I die
What's the harm if I don't mind?
With the paddle that empowers me
I can live a sinful life
