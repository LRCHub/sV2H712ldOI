Dear God,
I've come to repent my sins
Let your blood wash me clean
For I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm a rotten girl...
I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
The temptation
flowing through my veins
I'm bounded by
these shackles of shame...
I promised I'd indulge no more
But my heart, I can't ignore
In my dreams
they're turning up the heat
I'm a dirty, rotten girl
On lock,
underneath the bleachers
Just watch, Look beyond
the smoke and mirrors
Heartstruck?!
Shun the nonbeliever!
Our operation
would NEVER be complete
Red Hot!
tension with each whisper
Snapshot!
Quiet moans and muffled whimpers
Come on!
Can't you feel the fever-
Rising up?!
Rising up to the sky?!
As testaments echo,
fear ignites beneath my skin
The lord sayeth,
“halt thy child,
don’t give into sin”
It's driving me crazy
The urge to forsake thee
Yet, something shifts
within this wicked bliss
I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
Student council
breathing down my neck
I wonder if they're
hiding from me...?
Forbidden fruits before my eyes
And a taste that's so divine
My regrets rewriting history
I'm a sad, pathetic girl
Someone PLEASE tell me
what to do...
Because, HONESTLY
I just can't STOP!!
I've been trying so hard
and I can't STOPPPP---!
WHAT WOULD GOD THINK?!
and-I-
I know I'm supposed
to be a good girl,
but... SOMEHOW I JUST
CAN’T CONTROL MYSELF....
Everytime I see them....
touching skin to skin..........
My mind goes-
MY MIND GOES---
KYAAaAAAaAAAAAa4rftfgsdAAA----
Could Eve be our idol?
Could she lead us
through the light?
We’d all be disciples
of her lemon driven bite
Can somebody save me?
The urge to forsake thee
Still, something shifts
within this wicked bliss
-The power resting in my hands
-For my God has other plans
-In salvation I can live my life
-As an ordinary girl
I can't resist it anymore
Cause I smell slow burn galore
all the trauma
from a cobblestone
could never beat the devil in me
An honest sinner 'till I die
What's the harm if I don't mind?
With the paddle that empowers me
I can live a sinful life
